# Privacy Policy for Jared Web Extension

Last updated: November 26, 2023

## Introduction

As an individual developer distributing "Jared" as open-source software under the MIT license, I respect the privacy of the users ("user" or "you"). This Privacy Policy explains how I handle information in relation to the Jared Web Extension (the "Extension"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the Extension.

## Collection of Your Information

The only information collected is that which is provided by the Chrome Web Store in its standard operation. I do not collect any personal data, financial data, or other information from the users of the Extension.

## Use of Your Information

As the Extension currently does not collect any user data, there is no use of such data in any form. Should this change in the future, this policy will be updated accordingly.

## Disclosure of Your Information

Since no user data is collected, there is no disclosure of user information to any third parties.

## Tracking Technologies

The Extension does not use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, or any other tracking technologies.

## Third-Party Websites

The Extension does not include or offer third-party products or services.

## Security of Your Information

As no personal information is collected, there are no measures in place for data security pertaining to personal information.

## Policy for Children

The Extension does not knowingly collect information from or market to children under the age of 13.

## Controls for Do-Not-Track Features

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track (\`"DNT\`") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, the Extension does not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.

## Options Regarding Your Information

As the Extension does not collect or store any personal information, there are no options or actions required regarding your information.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the Extension's practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.

## Contact Me

If you have questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact me through the Chrome Web Store developer contact link.
